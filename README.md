# NGordnet

## Description: 
  - This project is inspired by Google's Ngram viewer. It creates a browser based tool that trackers the history of the usage English words and its hyponyms in text.
  - Explores how the volume of printed works in English has changed over time, as well as the structure of the is-a relationships of words in English.

## Features:
  - Implemented generic Abstract Data Structures in Java to analyze the hyponyms, relative popularity of words, categories & lengths of words over time using Zipf's law. Effectively utilized the semantic lexicon WordNet, Google's Ngram dataset and TimeSeries with an YearlyRecord to aid the NGordNet User Interface.
  - Used directed graphs to store entries from the WordNet dataset into ADTs to allow for rapid queries for hyponyms and hypernyms.
